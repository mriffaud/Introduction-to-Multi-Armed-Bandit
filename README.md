# Multi Armed Bandit from Scratch

This is a project which was inspired form the 2020 Christmas Kaggle Competition where two teams of elves have to collect as many candy canes as possible from vending machines with different rewards probabilities. The team with the most candy win.

The first is to import the necessary libraries. These are commonly used ones so the experiement is reproducible.
```python:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```
